NTv2 grid Bundeseinheitliche Transformation für ATKIS® (BeTA2007)
Free redistribution is allowed and welcome

Die Intention bei BeTA2007 war es, eine möglichst freie
Nutzung, ohne Einschränkung auf nicht kommerzielle Gebiete,
zuzulassen.

Die BeTA2007 Gitterdatei kann zur direkten Nutzung in
andere Software eingebunden bzw. zum Download angeboten werden.
Eine Namensnennung ist gewünscht. Auch einer Formatänderung,
sofern der ursprüngliche Genauigkeitsanspruch gewahrt bleibt,
steht nichts im Wege. Bei einer inhaltlichen Änderung/Erweiterung
darf der Name BeTA2007 nicht mehr weiter verwendet werden.
Das abgeleitete Produkt sollte dann über einen entsprechenden
Vermerk den Bezug herstellen
